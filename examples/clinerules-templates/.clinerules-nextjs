# Next.js/React Project Rules
# Copy this to your project root as .clinerules

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling — no inline styles or CSS modules
- Import order: React → external libs → internal components → styles

## Architecture
- Pages in app/ (App Router) or pages/ (Pages Router)
- Shared components in components/
- Utility functions in lib/
- API calls centralized in lib/api.ts

## Security
- Never store secrets in client-side code
- Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix only for truly public values
- Sanitize all user input before rendering
- Prefer HttpOnly cookies over localStorage for auth tokens

## Performance
- Use next/image for all images
- Lazy load heavy components with dynamic()
- Minimize client-side JavaScript — prefer Server Components

## Testing
- Tests alongside components: Component.test.tsx
- Use React Testing Library, not Enzyme

## Git
- Create feature branches from main
- Commit messages: type(scope): description
