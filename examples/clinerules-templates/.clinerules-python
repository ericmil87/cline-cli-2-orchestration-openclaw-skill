# Python/FastAPI Project Rules
# Copy this to your project root as .clinerules

## Code Style
- Use type hints on all function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Prefer Pydantic models for data validation

## Architecture
- Routers in api/routers/, services in api/services/, models in api/models/
- All database operations go through SQLAlchemy async sessions
- Use dependency injection via FastAPI Depends()

## Security
- Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries — never string-format SQL
- JWT tokens must be validated on every protected endpoint

## Testing
- Tests go in tests/ directory
- Use pytest with async support (pytest-asyncio)
- Mock external services, never call real APIs in tests

## Git
- Create feature branches from main
- Commit messages: type(scope): description
- Never commit .env files or secrets
