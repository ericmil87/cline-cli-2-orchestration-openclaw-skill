# General Project Rules
# Copy this to your project root as .clinerules

## Workflow
- Always create a branch before making changes
- Run existing tests before and after changes
- Commit with descriptive messages: type(scope): description

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code — avoid unnecessary comments
- Handle errors explicitly — never silently catch exceptions
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)
- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

## Security
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all external input
- Follow least-privilege principle

## Documentation
- Update README when adding features
- Document non-obvious decisions with comments
- Keep API docs in sync with code changes
